anonymous func -- No name is specified
    func() {

    }


Anonymous functions have a number of features which make them useful, two of which we're using above.

Firstly, they can be executed at the same time that they're declared - this is what the () at the end
of the anonymous function is doing.

Secondly they maintain access to the lexical scope they are defined in - all the variables that are
available at the point when you declare the anonymous function are also available in the body of the function.
