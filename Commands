* Anonymous functions have a number of features which make them useful, two of which we're using above.
* Firstly, they can be executed at the same time that they're declared - this is what the () at the end
  of the anonymous function is doing.
* Secondly they maintain access to the lexical scope they are defined in - all the variables that are
  available at the point when you declare the anonymous function are also available in the body of the function.

go test -race    -->   detects any race condition

* Reflection in computing is the ability of a program to examine its own structure, particularly through types;
  it's a form of metaprogramming.
  The typical use is to take a value with static type interface{} and
  extract its dynamic type information by calling TypeOf, which returns a Type.
